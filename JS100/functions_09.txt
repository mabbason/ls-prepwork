Excercises Functions 2

Excercise no 1
function greet(greeting = 'Hello') {
  console.log(greeting + ', world!');
}
Assigning the parameter to a value will set the default value of that parameter
if nothing is passed into the function.

Excercise no 2
function greet(greeting = 'Hello', recipient = 'world') {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + recipient + '!');
}
It produced the expected results.

Excercise no 3
function greeting() {
  return 'Good morning';
}

function recipient() {
  return 'Launch School';
}

function greet() {
  console.log(`${greeting()}, ${recipient()}!`);
}

greet();   
I used a template literal and just put in the functions.

function calculateBMI(height, weight) {
  let bmi = Math.round(((weight/((height/100)**2)) + Number.EPSILON) *100)/100;
  return bmi.toString();
}                       

console.log(calculateBMI(180,80));
I wasn't really sure, but with searching MDN and SO I was able to put the above together.
It seems a little complicated visually so I will be interested to see if there if a more
elegant solution. 
Ah of course there is a simpler way. I find it interesting that I didn't come across
the toFixed() method in my searches.

function catAge(humanAge) {
 let catAge;
 if (humanAge === 0) {
  catAge = 0;   
 } else if (humanAge === 1) {
  catAge = 15;
 }  else if (humanAge === 2) {
  catAge = 24;
 }  else {
   catAge = (humanAge - 2) * 4 + 24;
 }
return catAge;
}
Again there feels like there could be a more elegant solution out there. 
Originally I was trying to use a switch/case and take advantage of the 
fall through by not putting in a break. But I got screwed up and so I 
fell back to this kind of rudimentary if/then... I don't really like it though.
Bummmer, and then of course the solution is the switch statement... sigh
