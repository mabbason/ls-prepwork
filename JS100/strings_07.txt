Excercises - Strings

"These aren't the droids you're looking for.".length;
I just went the simple route and appended the property length to the string.

let string = 'confetti floating everywhere'.toUpperCase();
console.log(string);

function repeat(reps, str) {
  let i = 1;
  let rptString = '';
  while (i <= reps ) {
    rptString += str;
    i += 1;
  }
  return rptString;
}

console.log(repeat(5, 'ha'));
I had trouble with this one. It's the first one that I checked the solution first
before finding something that at least worked. I was so close, but I think the real 
thing that I missed was setting the empty string. I was setting it to the passed parameter string.

We can use either a template literal which will preserve our line breaks, or we 
can you the \n within a standard string to tell JavaScript to print on a new line.
Hmm, well it looks like I can't just use a template literal. I can but it's not as 
easy as just hitting return for a new line as I was alluding to.

You can convert each string with toUpperCase() or toLowerCase() before comparing them for example:

let string1 = 'Polar Bear';
let string2 = 'Polar bear';
let string3 = 'Penguin';
let comp;

if (string1.toLowerCase() === string3.toLowerCase()){
  comp = true;
} else {
  comp = false;
}

console.log(comp);

let byteSequence = 'TXkgaG92ZXJjcmFmdCBpcyBmdWxsIG9mIGVlbHMu';

console.log(/x/.test(byteSequence));
I think I missed this one before in a similar instance. I need to work on remembering the
usefulness of includes().

function isBlank(string) {
  return (string === true) ? true: false;
}

console.log(isBlank('mars'));
console.log(isBlank('    '));
console.log(isBlank(''));

I started overcomplicating this... but I did think it odd that an empty string
returned a true value. I thought that an empty string was falsy?? I did not come
up a successful version before looking at the solution though.

I did the same thing here... maybe I was just studying too long but my brain seems
in a rut with this. I was very close to the right solution. I read through the 
documentaton and almost used string.trim() but for some reason I thought of how 
that solution would break down. Obviously I was wrong and now that I consider it 
again, it seems pretty clear.

Haha, new day... I got this one. We will see how effecient I was, but I still got it.

let stringInitial = 'launch school tech & talk';

let stringCapWords = stringInitial.split(' ');

for (i = 0; i < stringCapWords.length; i += 1) {
  stringCapWords[i] = stringCapWords[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + stringCapWords[i].slice(1);
}

stringCapWords = stringCapWords.join(' ');

console.log(stringCapWords);

Great! I did it and even used less lines of code, but that may not be the goal. 
Either way I basically did it the same way as was proposed.
