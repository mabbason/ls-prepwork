Question no 1
What does code log to the terminal?
This touches on some of what I have had trouble with before... I am going to say that it logs...
undefined 	// because the foo() function doesn't return anything
1		// because the bar variable called in the function was just for inside that function
Alright an improvement, I got it correct... the main idea. I still fumbled the foo() and undefined

Question no 4
What does code log to the terminal?
I don't think it logs anything, the return kicks it out before the console log runs.

Question no 5
What does code log to the terminal?
This is what the last should have been... it logs 'Yipeee!!!!'
Bummer, you got me, I rushed to see the return fixed and then missed the console log.
