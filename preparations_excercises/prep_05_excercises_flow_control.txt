3,

false,
false,
false,
true,
false,

Awesome, that felt good! I felt pretty confident but it was nice to see I didn't have a 'gotcha'

Question no 2
Write evenOrOdd function

function evenOrOdd(numInput) {
  numInput % 2 === 1 ? console.log('odd') : console.log('even')
}

Question no 3
Improve evenOrOdd function

function evenOrOdd(numInput) {
  if (Number.isInteger(numInput)) {
  numInput % 2 === 1 ? console.log('odd') : console.log('even') 
  }  else { console.log('ERROR: evenOrOdd() needs an Integer as input');
  return;
  }
  
}

Question no 4
What does the following code log?
It would seem pretty straight forward... the string '113' gets passed as an argument for barCodeScanner function. Which puts it into a switch, but there are no breaks in the switch. So it will latch onto case '113' and then log the following:
Product2
Product3
Product not found!

Question no 5
Refactor to if statement

if (foo()) {
  return 'bar'; 
  } else {
  return qux();
  }
  
Question no 6 
What does code output to console?
I believe the empty array will NOT evaluate to false because it isn't looking inside the array. We can see it's empty but the code isn't pointing inside. And [] !== false so it will log:
'Not Empty'

Question no 7
Allcaps function if string longer than 10 characters.

function screamingTens (someString) {
  if (someString.length > 10) {
   return someString.toUpperCase();
  } else {
    return someString
  }
}

Question no 8
Write function for logging number range

function numberRange(numInput) {
  switch (numInput)
    case numInput > 100 : 
      console.log(`${numInput} is greater than 100`);
      break;
    case numInput < 0 :
      console.log(`${numInput} is less than 0`);
      break;
    case numInput < 51 :
      console.log(`${numInput} is between 0 and 50`);
      break;
    default :
      console.log(`${numInput} is between 51 and 100`);
      break;
}
