Write a function that computes and returns the factorial of a number by using a for loop. 
The factorial of a positive integer n, signified by n!, is defined as the product of all integers between 1 and n, inclusive:

response:

function factorialOfNumber(numInput) {
  let factorial = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= numInput; i += 1) {
    factorial = factorial * i;
  }
  return factorial;
}
