Excercise no 3
The following code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?

let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}

response:
  1. The while loop is testing a condition which will always be true
    - that is (counter = 1) will always be true because it isn't testing, it is assigning
  2. The second is that since the while loop condition always assigns counter to 1
    then it is only incremented up to 2 in the block and doesn't activate the MORE
    than 2 test to kick out with break.
