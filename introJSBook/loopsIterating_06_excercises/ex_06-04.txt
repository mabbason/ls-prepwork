Does the following code produce an error? 
Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

response:
This one was tricky, at first I thought it would produce an error. But have since
learned that within the console log call 'i' is still being incremented.
Thus while console log is logging, 'i' was incremented before that and will get
sent back up in the for loop.

output:
1
2
3
4
5
