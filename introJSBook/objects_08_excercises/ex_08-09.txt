What does the following program log to the console? Why?

let foo = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
};

let qux = 'hello';

function bar(argument1, argument2) {
  argument1.a = 'hi';
  argument2 = 'hi';
}

bar(foo, qux);

console.log(foo.a);
console.log(qux);

response:
The console will log the following

'hi'
'hello'

when bar() function is called, an object is passed as argument1 and while
at first glance is seems a variable is passed in as argument2 and then reassigned.
That is not the case. Argument2 is passed a string, not a variable. So on
Line 10 it is trying to assign a string to a string. It doesn't work and the
original assignment of 'hello' to qux sticks and is the one logged.
