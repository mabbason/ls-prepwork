Excercise no 7
Add a qux property with value 3 to the myObj object we created in 
the previous exercise. Now, examine the following code snippets:

let myProtoObj = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let myObj = Object.create(myProtoObj);
objKeys['qux'] = 3;

Snippet 1
let objKeys = Object.keys(myObj);
objKeys.forEach(function(key) {
  console.log(key);
});

Snippet 1 Output:
foo
bar
qux

Object.keys(myObj) creates an array of ONLY the keys from myObj
then the forEach iterates and logs that... so only the keys of myObj

Snippet 2
for (let key in myObj) {
  console.log(key);
}

Snippet 2 Output:
1
2
3

the for/in loop goes through the myObj object and only outputs the VALUE 
for each key as it goes along

Hmm, apparently I didn't understand the usage of the for/in loop. 
Ah, I see... I wasn't seeing the syntax correctly in the chapter.
That and the Object.keys ONLY acting on the objects OWN keys.
