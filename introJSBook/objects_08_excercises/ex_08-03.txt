Use object literal syntax (e.g., { key: value, ... } notation) to create an 
bject that behaves as an array in a for statement. The object should contain 
at least 3 elements. You should place your code between the braces in 
the let statement:

let myArray = {
};

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}

response:

let myArray = {
  0: 'this',
  1: 'is',
  2: 'a',
  3: 'test'
};

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}

I was missing the length part of this excercise. I wasn't clever enough
to think of the dot notaton and imparting a "length" to the array mimic.
