Which of the following values are primitive values? 
Which are objects? Which are neither?

"foo"
3.1415
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
false
foo
function bar() { return "bar"; }
undefined
{ a: 1, b: 2 }

response:
"foo"                                // Primitive
3.1415                               // Primitive       
[ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]                    // Object
false                                // Primitive
foo                                  // Neither, nothing to make it a string
function bar() { return "bar"; }     // Neither, function
undefined                            // Primitive
{ a: 1, b: 2 }                       // Object


I got the function wrong, I was only thinking arrays and objects were objects.
I think that I was lumping functions in with the idea of a statement or an expression.
