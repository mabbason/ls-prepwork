What does this program log to the console? Why?

let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);

response:
This will log 'bar' to the console. 'qux' is assigned to foo in the block scope
but by the time console goes to log anything the variable has been destroyed and
the only foo left standing is the global scoped 'bar'
