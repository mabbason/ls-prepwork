Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?

const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);

response:
No this will not produce an error as both 'FOO' variables exist within their own scope.
Even though the global FOO exists inside the block as well, for the purpose of the block
it will exist as 'qux'

it effectively looks at them as two separate variables:
global scope FOO
block scope FOO
