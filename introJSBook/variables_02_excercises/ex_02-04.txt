What happens when you run the following code? Why?

const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

response:
We should get 
'Good Morning, Victor'
'Good Afternoon, Victor'
'Good Evening, Victor'
Then JS should error because NAME is a constant and can't be reassigned.
I believe that the solution said it will continue with logging the same
greetings with Victor again, but when I run it through node REPL is stops
at the error.
