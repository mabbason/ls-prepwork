Use the template literal syntax along with the expression Number('5') + 10 to log the following sentence to the console:

The value of 5 + 10 is 15.

response: template literal

let sentence = `The value of 5 + 10 is ${Number('5') + 10}.`;
console.log(sentence);

No I did not remember the trailing period.
