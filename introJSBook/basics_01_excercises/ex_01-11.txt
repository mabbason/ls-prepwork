Excercise no 11
What value does the following expression evaluate to?

parseInt('3.1415')

parseInt works with numbers, this is a string, so this probably evaluates to NaN.
Bummer... I got this right the first time through when the material was fresh in my mind.
Hopefully over time and repetition this type of knowledge will become second nature.
