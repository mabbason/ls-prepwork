Excercise no 12
What value does the following expression evaluate to?

'12' < '9'

When using comparisons with strings, JavaScript compares letter/digit by digit.
But I wonder if there is some type of coercion here. I am going to go with a standard
digit by digit comparison... so I am going to say 'true'
