Excercise no 2
Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

thousands place is 4
(number - (number % 1000)) / 1000

hundreds place is 9
((number % 1000) - ((number % 1000) % 100)) / 100

tens place is 3
(number % 100 - (number % 10)) / 10

ones place is 6
number % 10

seems like I might have been overcomplicating things with how
I interpreted the excercise.
