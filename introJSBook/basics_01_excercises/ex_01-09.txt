Excercise no 9
Create an object named pets that contains a list of pet names and the type of animal.

let pets = {
  jellybean: 'cat',
  cali: 'turtle',
  henrietta: 'chicken',
  grayson: 'cat',
  meatball: 'dog';
};

I forgot the trailing semi-colon, I am having a little trouble knowing which things
to put a semicolon behind.
