What does this code log to the console? 
Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);

response:
This logs
1

foo() is run, but it is acting on a local scope 'bar' NOT the global 'bar' variable
so it doesn't change the value of the variable that is logged.
if it had been written:

let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);

then I believe it WOULD change the value of global 'bar'
