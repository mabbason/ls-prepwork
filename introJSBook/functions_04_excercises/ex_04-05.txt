Excercise no 5
What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee');

response:
This got me on the last go around through the excercises. I was only looking for
the return in the function and I missed the console.log had gone missing.
This will also not log anything as there is no 'console.log' statement
