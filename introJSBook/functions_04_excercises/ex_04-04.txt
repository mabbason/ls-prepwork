What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');

response:
this does not log anything to the console as the console.log doesn't get read before JavaScript
is kicked out of the function by the return on the preceding line
