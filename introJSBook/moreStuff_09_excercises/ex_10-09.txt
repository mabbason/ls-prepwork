Excercise no 9
Challenge excercise... determining -0.

response:
I think I have this one! I searched through some of the MDN Math methods
and thought I could use Math.sign. I tried many examples and all of them 
worked so I think this is good to go.

function isNegativeZero (value) {
  let result;
  if (value === 0) {
    if (Math.sign(1/value) > 0){
      result = false;
    } else {result = true;}
  } else { result = false; }
  return result;
}

Wow, as usual there was a much simpler way to do this. I have a feeling
this is going to be a recurring thing as I continue to learn.
