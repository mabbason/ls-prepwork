What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

response: 
Exception handling is when your program anticipates the potential for certain
types of failures and has built in logic to handle those errors. It solves
the problem of the program not running to completion.

I was kind of in the ballpark but I see some of the nuance I missed.
