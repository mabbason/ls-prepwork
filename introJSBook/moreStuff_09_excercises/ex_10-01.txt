What does this code log to the console? Why?

let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = array1;
array1[1] = 4;
console.log(array2);

response:
It logs [1, 4, 3] to the console because both array assignments are pointing
to the same array in memory. So when array1 gets mutated, array2 is pointing
to the same array still so it logs the changed array.
